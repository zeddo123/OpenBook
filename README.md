# OpenBook
## Open source Book Database.
As of now there is no good *open book dbs*.
the aim of Openbook is to have a **open source** and free book database that no one will have control over it !.

Every miner will be rewarded for mining the block, and adding books *'transactions'* to the network.

## Disclaimer
In **no** way this is a polished or secure network.
I'm just playing around,but i still think that's a great application for the blockchain

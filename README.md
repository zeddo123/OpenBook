# OpenBook
## Open source Book Database.
As of now there is no good *open book dbs*.
the aim of Openbook is to have a **open source** and free book database that no one will have control over it !.

Every miner will be rewarded for mining the block, and adding books *'transactions'* to the network.

## Disclaimer
In **no** way this is a polished or secure network.
I'm just playing around,but i still think that's a great application for the blockchain

# Use
## How to
For now, There is 3 scripts **(*node.py*, *seed.py*, *client.py*)**.
1. Run the seed script, this script must run in the beginning to link all the node.
2. Run the node script it's the main script, that follow the protocol and interract with other nodes/peers and do all the blockchain stuff.
3. This script is ran when we need to add a transaction into the chain.(This script needs to connect to the seed server to get the nodes)
